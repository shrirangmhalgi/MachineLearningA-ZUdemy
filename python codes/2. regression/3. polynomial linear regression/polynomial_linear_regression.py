# y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x1^2 + .... + bnx1^n
# limited use cases are for polynomial linear regression
# eg. disease spread
# even after there are different powers for x, why is it called polynomial 'linear' regression? 
# when we are talking about polynomial linear regression, we are not talking about x but we are talking about the constant b0, b1, etc
# y is a function of x can this function be expressed as a linear combination of the coefficients ultimately, they are the unknowns
# our goal is to find the values of the coefficients and use those coefficients to plug in x and ultimately find the value of y
