# CART : Classification and Regression Trees
# there are 2 types of decision trees : classification trees and regression trees
# regression trees are a bit more complex than classification trees
# consider a scatter plot which represents our data there are 2 independent variables x1 and x2 and we want to predict the 3rd varibale which is a dependent variable y
# the algorithm will be splitted into segments. just go to on splitting your data.
# how the splits are conducted is decided by algorithm and it actually involves information entrophy
# by each splitting are we deriving new information from the data? if yes then split if no then stop
# each split is called as a leaf
# it just creates a binary tree of conditions
# the leaf contains the dependent variable 
# the average of the terminal leaves is taken and then this is the value which is assigned to that leaf
